# Testing


## Jest

We are using Jest as test runner

## Environment

The test environment is set with the [JestExtend.js](../jest/JestExtend.js).

## Test-library

We are using test library as specialized test framework above Jest.

They:
  * have special assertion matcher for the dom
  * and can simulate [click](https://testing-library.com/docs/ecosystem-user-event#clickelement-eventinit-options)
and more.

There is also a [playground](https://testing-playground.com/)
